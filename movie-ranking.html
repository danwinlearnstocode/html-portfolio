<h1>The Greatest Movies According to Danwin</h1>

<h2>My Top 5 Movies of The Last 5 Years</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dune 1 & 2</h3>

<p>Denis Viilenue really did a great job in bringing some epic cinematography to the big screen. 
    The slow build and locations dipicted in the futuristic world is really beautiful,
    and the acting was top by Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya</p>

<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>

<p>I don't think this movie needs any introduction. Tom Cruise again gracing the big screens with
    a big budget movie filled with action and heart racing scenes that will have you wanting for
    more.</p>

<h3>John Wick 4</h3>

<p>All I have to say about John Wick 4 is ... bang, bang it's the Boogeyman!</p>
